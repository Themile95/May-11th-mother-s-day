<b>The Heart Of Home</b><br>

From the moment I first opened my eyes,<br>
You were there, my earth and skies.<br>
A gentle voice, a steady hand,<br>
My first true guide to understand.<br>

You taught me love with soft goodnights,<br>
And courage through the hardest fights.<br>
You held me close when I was small,<br>
And helped me rise from every fall.<br>

Your days began before the sun,<br>
And ended when your work was done—<br>
But even then, you’d find the grace<br>
To wear a smile upon your face.<br>

You packed my lunch, tied my shoe,<br>
Taught me how to think things through.<br>
You calmed my storms and shared my joy,<br>
Through every stage, your girl or boy.<br>

The way you knew just what to say,<br>
To lift my spirit, clear the way—<br>
Your words were wisdom, calm and kind,<br>
A treasure chest within my mind.<br>

When I was lost or filled with doubt,<br>
You’d wrap your arms and pull me out.<br>
You saw in me what I could be,<br>
Even when I couldn't see.<br>

You gave me roots so I could grow,<br>
And wings to see the world and go.<br>
And though I’ve traveled far and wide,<br>
I carry you here, deep inside.<br>

You’re not just “Mom,” you’re soul and light,<br>
A quiet force, a glowing knight.<br>
You fought for me in silent ways,<br>
In countless, selfless, unseen days.<br>

The meals you made, the nights you stayed,<br>
The dreams you chased but once delayed—<br>
All for me, without regret,<br>
A debt I never can forget.<br>

No crown could match the worth you hold,<br>
No poem catch your heart of gold.<br>
Still I offer these humble lines,<br>
To thank you for the endless times—<br>

You gave your all, you stood so strong,<br>
You knew the words when I was wrong,<br>
You loved with fire, deep and true—<br>
The world is better, Mom, through you.<br>

So on this Mother’s Day I send<br>
More love than I could ever lend.<br>
You are my first, forever home—<br>
My heart, my hero, all my own.<br>
